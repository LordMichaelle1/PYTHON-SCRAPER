# Output files (like screenshots or data files, if you don't want to commit them)
# *.png
# *.csv 
# If you DO want to commit your CSV, comment out or remove the *.csv line above.
# For now, let's assume you might want to commit the current CSVs as a baseline.
# So, you can omit *.csv for now or comment it out.

# Bright Data log files if any are created
